# Part 1 : Quizz :
# Answer the following questions

# What is a class?
# Itâ€™s a blueprint or a template for creating objects 

# What is an instance? 
# It is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object belonging to a specific class

# What is encapsulation?
# It is a concept used to bundle data and methods into easy-to-use units

# What is abstraction?
# It is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess

# What is inheritance?
# It is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another.

# What is multiple inheritance?
# That's when a class can inherit from two different classes

# What is polymorphism?
# The ability to use a standard interface for multiple forms or data types

# What is method resolution order or MRO?
# It is the order in which a method is searched for in a classes hierarchy



# Part 2: Create A Deck Of Cards Class.
# The Deck of cards class should NOT inherit from a Card class.

# The requirements are as follows:

# The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
# The Deck class :
# should have a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.
# should have a method called deal which deals a single card from the deck. After a card is dealt, it should be removed from the deck.
