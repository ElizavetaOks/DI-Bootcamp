# Create a new file called anagram_checker.py which contains a class called AnagramChecker.

# The class should have the following methods:
# __init__ - should load the word list file (text file) into a variable, so that it can be searched later on in the code.
# is_valid_word(word) – should check if the given word (ie. the word of the user) is a valid word.

# get_anagrams(word) – should find all anagrams for the given word. (eg. if word of the user is ‘meat’, the function should return a list containing [“mate”, “tame”, “team”].)

# Hint: you might want to create a separate method called is_anagram(word1, word2), that will compare 2 words and return True if they contain the same letters (but not in the same order), and False if not.

# Note: None of the methods in the class should print anything.
